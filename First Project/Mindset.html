      <div>
        <ul>
          <li><h3>Trust the system</h3></li>
            The system has worked time and time again for everyone. Trust the
            system and you will be successful. If something's wrong, it has to be
            you. Don't question the system and nothing can go wrong!
            
          <li><h3>Time</h3></li>
            This will not make you a millionare overnight, and anyone giving
            you that impression is obviously out to scam you. When you're apart
             of NotAPyramidScheme Co., you'll see that everyone here is
             constantly on the grind. If you're not hungry for success and
             wealth, this is not meant for you.

          <li><h3>The Naysayers</h3></li>
            Find out who's really in your corner when you try to achieve
            success. Anyone who tells you to quit, whoever it is, drop them.
            These are the people who will drag you down to their levels of
            mediocrity. Some people just feel better knowing your worse off
            than them. Truly toxic people. Sometimes it'll even be your parents,
            so it would be better to just avoid telling them about it at all.
